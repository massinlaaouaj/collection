# SECURE YOUR SSHD_CONFIG
# REPO: https://github.com/massinlaaouaj/Templates

# [INFO]
# THIS CONFIGURATION DOESN't INCLUDE DEFAULTS OF OpenSSH, ONLY
# CLEAN CONF.
# The restriction of this service is a good policy to fortify the security
# of our servers.

# 1.Change your ssh port, example (Remember there are ports that is 
# resticed for some services):
Port 4554

# 2.Only can access with IPv4:
AddressFamily inet

# 3.If you want to record more information - such as failed login attempts
# - you should increase the logging level to VERBOSE:
LogLevel VERBOSE

# 4.Disable Root Access:
PermitRootLogin no

# 5.Specifies the maximum number of authentication attempts permitted per
# connection:
MaxAuthTries 3
MaxSessions 3

# 6.specifies if the SSH server allows login to accounts with empty
# password strings:
PermitEmptyPasswords no

# 7.Control support for the "keyboard-interactive" authentication:
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no

# 8.If we use passwords we don't need PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules
# ) and we allow sshd to function as a non-root user:
UsePAM yes

# 9.Print the date and time of the last user login:
PrintLastLog yes

# 10.It tells us that the sshd server will send keepalive messages to the
# client after it detects some inactivity. It is advisable to disable it to$TCPKeepAlive no

# 11.Specifies the maximum number of concurrent unauthenticated connections
# to the SSH daemon:
MaxStartups 3

# 12.Create your own banner:
Banner /etc/ssh/banner_ssh

# 13.Allow client to pass locale environment variables
AcceptEnv LANG LC_*

# 14.Override default of no subsystems
Subsystem       sftp    /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server

# 15.Limit the system users who can enter via SSH:
#AllowUsers [username1] [username2]...

# 16.There are two versions of SSH in terms of its communication protocol,
# SSHv1 and SSHv2.
#       SSHv1 protocol is deprecated, but is still included for
#       compatibility. SSHv1 has several known vulnerabilities.

#       SSHv2 protocol, which has an improved key exchange algorithm and
#       is not vulnerable.
Protocol 2
